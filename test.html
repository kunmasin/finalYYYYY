Subject: Formal Complaint Regarding Ajadi Kareem

Dear Dean of Students Affairs,

I am writing to formally bring to your attention a concerning matter regarding one of my students, Ajadi Kareem, who is enrolled in the [Software Construction/ SEN 305] under my supervision. Despite repeated efforts to address the issues, I have observed several ongoing behavioral and academic concerns which I believe warrant the school’s attention.

The following are specific instances of concern:

Academic misconduct: On April 4th 2024, Ajadi Kareem was found to be involved in cheating during an exam, submitting plagiarized work].
Disruptive behavior in class: On multiple occasions, Ajadi Kareem has displayed disruptive behavior, including interrupting lectures, being disrespectful to fellow students and staff.
Failed to comply with academic instructions: Despite being warned several times, Ajadi Kareem has failed to submit assignments on time, follow course guidelines.
I have tried addressing these issues directly with Ajadi Kareem and have given him multiple opportunities to correct the behavior. Unfortunately, there has been little to no improvement. I believe this matter now requires the attention and action of the school management.

I request that an appropriate investigation be conducted and necessary disciplinary actions be taken, as per the school’s policies. I am available to provide further details or any documentation if needed.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt action.

Sincerely,
Oniye Abdulayi (Senior Lecturer)
